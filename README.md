# Warn Me
This Google Chrome extension warns a user if there are any subjects that need a trigger warning on a webpage.     
- Users have the ability to add their own trigger words which are stored through Chrome's Storage Sync from the Google Chrome Storage API.  
- Using Javascript's Mutation Observer, this extension also accounts for constantly updating webpages such as a scrolling Facebook Newsfeed.
